# DatabasesFinalProject

Jeffrey Sham, Tyler Lee

For our final project, we created a Film Awards database. We found csvs online and parsed them using
Java. With this information, we created a website (http://ugrad.cs.jhu.edu/~tlee93/ ). This website 
allows you to query the database if you do not have login credentials. If you do have login credentials,
you can query the database, vote, and edit information such as your date of birth or film information
(if you are a director). 

Enjoy!
